# Hi There! 

I'm a fourth year PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine. My advisor is [Jesse Wolfson](https://jpwolfson.com/). I am interested in studying the topology of algebraic/analytic varieties and their applications to number theory, using concepts and tools that have emerged from the philosophy of motives. I am also interested in topological phases of matter. Here is my [CV](CV (8).pdf)

Preprints:
- [The Standard Realizations for the K-Theory of Varieties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01168) (with [Oliver Braunling](https://www.braunling.org/) and [Michael Groechenig](http://individual.utoronto.ca/groechenig/)). Submitted for publication.
  
- [Weight Filtrations and Derived Motivic Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06879).

In Preparation:
- A Filtration on the Space of Symmetric Matrices of Fixed Rank

Expository Papers:

- [An Introduction to Brownian Motion](/An_Introduction_to_Brownian_Motion (2).pdf)
- [The Fourier Operator and The Characteristic Function](/Bootcamp_Probability_Lecture.pdf)
- [An Introduction to Wall's Obstruction Theorem](/Wall_s_Obstruction_Theorem.pdf)
- [A Very Brief Introduction to the Path Integral in QM](/An_Introduction_to_Feynman_Path_Integral_Formalism (3).pdf)
