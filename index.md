I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine. My advisor is [Jesse Wolfson](https://jpwolfson.com/). I am interested in studying the topology of algebraic/analytic varieties and their applications to number theory, using concepts and tools that have emerged from the philosophy of motives. I am also interested in topological phases of matter.  I am on the job market. Here is my [CV](\CV(12).pdf)

I did my bachelors in mathematics from the University of Chicago, where I ran the undergradate [applied mathematics club!](https://ucamc.github.io/)
