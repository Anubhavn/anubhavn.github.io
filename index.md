# Hi There! 

I'm a third year PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine. My advisor is [Jesse Wolfson](https://jpwolfson.com/). I am interested in studying the topology of algebraic/analytic varieties and their applications to number theory, using concepts and tools that have emerged from the philosophy of motives. As an undergraduate, I created the [UChicago Applied Mathematics Club (UCAMC)](https://ucamc.github.io/). Currently, I am a middle school mentor at [Math CEO](https://sites.ps.uci.edu/mathceo/), a community educational outreach program designed to increase the number of talented students from diverse backgrounds who pursue higher education in STEM and/or STEM careers.

Preprints:
- [The Standard Realizations for the K-Theory of Varieties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01168) (with [Oliver Braunling](https://www.braunling.org/) and [Michael Groechenig](http://individual.utoronto.ca/groechenig/)). Submitted for publication.

In Preparation:
- A Gillet-Soul√© Approach to Derived Motivic Measures

Expository Papers:

- [An Introduction to Brownian Motion](/An_Introduction_to_Brownian_Motion (2).pdf)
- [The Fourier Operator and The Characteristic Function](/Bootcamp_Probability_Lecture.pdf)
- [An Introduction to Wall's Obstruction Theorem](/Wall_s_Obstruction_Theorem.pdf)
- [A Very Brief Introduction to the Path Integral in QM](/An_Introduction_to_Feynman_Path_Integral_Formalism (3).pdf)
