- [An Introduction to Brownian Motion](/An_Introduction_to_Brownian_Motion (2).pdf)
- [The Fourier Operator and The Characteristic Function](/Bootcamp_Probability_Lecture.pdf)
- [A Brief Introduction to Differential Forms in R^n and the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem](/Nanavaty_FINAL.pdf)
- [Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Autonomous ODE's](/Bootcamp_ODE_Lecture_7_3_18.pdf)
