# Hi There! 

I'm a second year PhD student at the University of California, Irvine. My advisor is [Jesse Wolfson](https://jpwolfson.com/). I am interested in studying the topology of algebraic/analytic varieties and their applications to number theory, using concepts and tools that have emerged from the philosophy of motives. As an undergraduate, I created the [UChicago Applied Mathematics Club (UCAMC)](https://ucamc.github.io/). Currently I volunteer with [https://sites.ps.uci.edu/mathceo/](Math CEO), a Community Educational Outreach program designed to increase the number of talented students from diverse backgrounds who pursue higher education in STEM and/or STEM careers.

Preprints:
- [The Standard Realizations for the K-Theory of Varieties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01168) (with [Oliver Braunling](https://www.braunling.org/) and [Michael Groechenig](http://individual.utoronto.ca/groechenig/)). Submitted for publication.
